# CQRS-with-MediatR
CQRS using MediatR library and latest .NetCore along with C#9.


### Installing MediatR
You should install MediatR with NuGet:
`
Install-Package MediatR
`

To Install Dependency for services.AddMediatR method (which is not resolved by NetCore out of the box):
`
Install-Package MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`

Dotnet add package MediatR
Either commands, from Package Manager Console or .NET Core CLI, will download and install MediatR and all required dependencies.
